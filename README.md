## About
Kraken is designed to be the only duplicate file remover you'll ever need. It's easy and efficient, and runs on Windows, MacOS and Linux.

## Getting Started
To get started using Kraken, head to the [releases](https://google.com/) tab on this repo and install the version built for your operating system.
It should be noted that, whilst Kraken is built to be .NET independant, you may still have to install the [.NET 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) runtime if you're having problems.
